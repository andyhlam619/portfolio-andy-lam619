## Design
CarCar is an application to manage aspects of an automobile dealership. The main 3 microservices that tie this whole application together is the inventory, service center, and the sales center. The inventory api provides us with Manufacturer, Vehicle Model, and Automobile RESTful API endpoints. The other services will be explained further down below.

The front-end: React
The back-end: Django
The database: PostgreSQL
